<h4 style="color:rgb(95, 10, 10);padding-left:10px">Each day holds a surprise. But only if we expect it can we see, 
   hear, or feel it when it comes to us. Let's not be afraid to receive each day's surprise, whether it comes 
   to us as sorrow or as joy It will open a new place in our hearts, a place where we can welcome new friends 
   and celebrate more fully our shared humanity.</h4>
